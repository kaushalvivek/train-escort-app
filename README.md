## Introduction

My dad works for the Indian Railways, and when special trains started running to transport migrant labourers during India’s response to the COVID-19, he discussed the logistical issue of managing police escorts on these trains and coordinating with different government agencies.
This is a simple web app created using vanilla JS HTML/CSS with a Python Flask Server and a SQLite database.
